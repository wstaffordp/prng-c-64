#### FlurryBurst64Low32

FlurryBurst64Low32 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M, XSH RR, XSH RS and XSL RR variants of PCG32.

It has a period of at least 2⁶⁴.

Seeding `a` with non-overlapping integers, seeding `b` with `0` and seeding `c` with `a + 1` behaves as a jump function with up to 2⁶⁴ parallel instances that each have a non-overlapping period of at least 2⁶⁴. The first several results from each parallel instance should be skipped.

In non-parallel instances, `a` must be assigned a seed and the remaining state must be seeded with `0`.

##### C

`flurryburst64low32` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint32_t` integer, provided the implementation supports a 32-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint32_t` and a 64-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint64_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst64Low32` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint` integer.

---

#### FlurryBurst32

FlurryBurst32 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M XS variants of PCG32 and Xorshift32.

It has a period of at least 2³⁶.

Seeding `a` with non-overlapping integers, seeding `b` with `0` and seeding `c` with `a + 1` behaves as a jump function with up to 2³² parallel instances that each have a non-overlapping period of at least 2³². The first several results from each parallel instance should be skipped.

In non-parallel instances, `a` must be assigned a seed and the remaining state must be seeded with `0`.

##### C

`flurryburst32` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint32_t` integer, provided the implementation supports a 32-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint32_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst32` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint` integer.

#### FlurryBurst32Low16

FlurryBurst32Low16 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M, XSH RR and XSH RS variants of PCG16.

It has a period of at least 2³².

Seeding `a` with non-overlapping integers, seeding `b` with `0` and seeding `c` with `a + 1` behaves as a jump function with up to 2³² parallel instances that each have a non-overlapping period of at least 2³². The first several results from each parallel instance should be skipped.

In non-parallel instances, `a` must be assigned a seed and the remaining state must be seeded with `0`.

##### C

`flurryburst32low16` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint16_t` integer, provided the implementation supports a 16-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint16_t` and a 32-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint32_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst32Low16` generates and returns a pseudorandom `ushort` integer.

#### FlurryBurst16

FlurryBurst16 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M XS variants of PCG16 and Xorshift16 "798".

It has a period of at least 2²⁰.

Seeding `a` with non-overlapping integers, seeding `b` with `0` and seeding `c` with `a + 1` behaves as a jump function with up to 2¹⁶ parallel instances that each have a non-overlapping period of at least 2¹⁶. The first several results from each parallel instance should be skipped.

In non-parallel instances, `a` must be assigned a seed and the remaining state must be seeded with `0`.

##### C

`flurryburst16` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint16_t` integer, provided the implementation supports a 16-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint16_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst16` generates and returns a pseudorandom `ushort` integer.

#### FlurryBurst16Low8

FlurryBurst16Low8 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M, XSH RR and XSH RS variants of PCG8 and Xorshift16 "798" truncated to 8 low bits.

It has a period of at least 2¹⁶.

Seeding `a` with non-overlapping integers, seeding `b` with `0` and seeding `c` with `a + 1` behaves as a jump function with up to 2¹⁶ parallel instances that each have a non-overlapping period of at least 2¹⁶. The first several results from each parallel instance should be skipped.

In non-parallel instances, `a` must be assigned a seed and the remaining state must be seeded with `0`.

##### C

`flurryburst16low8` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint8_t` integer, provided the implementation supports an 8-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint8_t` and a 16-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint16_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst16Low8` generates and returns a pseudorandom `byte` integer.

---

#### FlurryBurst8

FlurryBurst8 provides enhanced parallelism, period, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M XS variants of PCG8 and Xorshift8 "315".

It has a period of between 2¹⁴ and 2¹⁵, precisely 18688.

`a` must be seeded with `0` and `b` must be assigned a seed. Incrementing `b` by `2` whenever `a` is `0` behaves as a jump function. Generating 73 subsequent integers after either jumping or seeding the state resets `a` to `0`. 256 repetitions of both generating 73 subsequent integers and jumping generates the same frequency of integers as a full cycle that generates 18688 integers without jumping.

##### C

`flurryburst8` generates and returns a pseudorandom `uint8_t` integer, provided the implementation supports an 8-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint8_t`.

##### C#

`Next` from `FlurryBurst8` generates and returns a pseudorandom `byte` integer.
